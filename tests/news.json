          "text": "The U.S. will announce a major package of sanctions against Russia on Friday over the death of opposition leader Alexei Navalny and the two-year Ukraine war, President Joe Biden said on Tuesday. Biden, speaking to reporters as he departed on a trip to California, did not give details. The latest sanctions on Russia will target a range of items, including the country's defense and industrial bases, along with sources of revenue for the economy, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said. The package will 'hold Russia accountable for what happened to Mr. Navalny' and for its actions over the course of the war in Ukraine, White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said. A senior U.S. official said a sanctions package was already being planned to mark the second anniversary of the war, which Washington will now reconsider and supplement in response to Navalny's death. The Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, Brian Nelson, is discussing sanctions over Navalny's death on a trip to Europe this week, two sources familiar with the matter said. Nelson, in visits to Germany, Belgium and France ahead of the second anniversary of the Ukraine war, is also discussing Washington's authority to target those funding Russia's war production efforts even if they are in third countries, the Treasury said. It said the U.S. is 'aggressively pursuing those who attempt to evade our sanctions.' The United States already has issued a wide array of sanctions related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 2022, including on Russian President Vladimir Putin, officials and banks. Washington has also previously imposed sanctions over the 2020 poisoning and imprisonment of Navalny, targeting among them people linked to Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) and other officials. Navalny, Putin's fiercest domestic critic, fell unconscious and died suddenly on Friday after a walk at the 'Polar Wolf' penal colony above the Arctic Circle where he was serving a three-decade sentence, the prison service said. Speaking to reporters on a conference call, Kirby said the United States is pressing Russia for 'complete transparency' on how Navalny died last Friday. Biden has blamed Putin.'Whatever story the Russian government decides to tell the world, it's clear that President Putin and his government are responsible for Mr. Navalny's death,' Kirby said. The U.S. embassy in Moscow has been seeking more information about Navalny's death, Kirby said, 'but it's difficult to get a point where you can be confident in what the Russians would say about his death.'",

          "text": "A Commons debate on calls for a ceasefire in Gaza descended into chaos, after the Speaker was accused of allowing it to be \"hijacked\" by Labour. Sir Lindsay Hoyle sparked fury from the SNP and Conservatives when he broke with convention to allow a vote on a Labour motion for an \"immediate humanitarian ceasefire\". The Speaker later apologised, saying he had acted \"with the right intentions\". But the SNP said they had been \"treated with complete and utter contempt\". Labour's amendment went through to loud shouts of \"aye\" without a formal vote, after the government said it would not take part in protest. This meant there was no vote on the SNP's motion, which called for an \"immediate ceasefire\", and was originally meant to be the focus of the debate. The government does not have to adopt Labour's position as the vote is not binding. Labour calls for Gaza immediate humanitarian ceasefire. Why are Israel and Hamas fighting in Gaza? In extraordinary scenes, SNP MPs and some Tories walked out of the chamber over the Speaker's handling of the vote. Following calls for him to return to explain his decision, Sir Lindsay told the Commons he chose to allow a vote on the Labour motion so MPs could express their view on \"the widest range of propositions\". Amid shouts of resign, he said: \"I thought I was doing the right thing and the best thing, and I regret it, and I apologise for how it's ended up. \"I do take responsibility for my actions, and that's why I want to meet with the key players who have been involved.\" SNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn said whilst he acknowledged the Speaker's apology, Commons officials had warned the decision could lead to his party not having a vote, on a day which had been designated an SNP opposition day. Visibly furious, he said his party had been treated \"with complete and utter contempt\". \"I will take significant convincing that your position is not now intolerable,\" he added. In a statement after the debate, Mr Flynn said it was \"a disgrace that Sir Keir Starmer and the Speaker colluded to block Parliament voting on the SNP motion\". \"This should have been the chance for the UK Parliament to do the right thing and vote for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and Israel - instead it turned into a Westminster circus,\" he added. UK Parliament Sir Lindsay HoyleUK Parliament Sir Lindsay returned to the chamber to apologise to MPs It came after Commons leader Penny Mordaunt said Sir Lindsay had \"undermined the confidence\" of the House and suggested his decision had allowed the debate to be \"hijacked\" by Labour. She said this had \"has raised temperatures in this House on an issue where feelings are already running high\". Earlier, a source close to the Speaker said the suggestion he was pressurised was \"absolutely untrue\". Sir Keir accused the Conservatives and SNP of \"choosing political games over serious solutions\". \"Today was a chance for Parliament to unite and speak with one voice on the horrendous situation in Gaza and Israel,\" he said in a statement following the debate. Sir Lindsay was first elected as a Labour MP but after becoming Speaker he relinquished his party affiliation, as is the convention. While he said he would meet key MPs from the main parties to discuss what happened, intense pressure remains on the Speaker. More than 30 Tory and SNP MPs have declared they have no confidence in him by signing an early day motion. Very few early day motions are debated but they allow MPs to show their support for an issue. Hundreds queue to lobby MPs over Gaza ceasefire vote The debate took place as thousands of pro-Palestinian demonstrators gathered in Parliament Square. Throughout the day, a long queue had formed outside the Commons, with protesters hoping to lobby MPs in person to support a ceasefire. Sir Lindsay's decision meant Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer avoided another potential rebellion over the party's position on Gaza as Labour MPs were able to show their support for a ceasefire without voting for an SNP motion. The motion went further than Labour's by calling for an end to the \"collective punishment of the Palestinian people\". Labour's shadow foreign secretary David Lammy also argued it did not \"lay out a path to a sustainable peace\" and \"appears to be one-sided\". \"For any ceasefire to work it must by necessity be observed by all sides,\" he added. Labour's own amendment noted that Israel \"cannot be expected to cease fighting if Hamas continues with violence\" and called for a diplomatic process to deliver \"a safe and secure Israel alongside a viable Palestinian state\". Last November Sir Keir suffered a major revolt when 56 of his MPs, including 10 frontbenchers, defied him to back an SNP motion urging an immediate ceasefire. Earlier this week, Labour shifted its position to call for \"an immediate humanitarian ceasefire\", following months of pressure from backbenchers and activists. The government is calling for \"an immediate humanitarian pause\", as well as supporting moves towards a \"permanent sustainable ceasefire\". Israel launched its operations in Gaza following an attack by Hamas on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and more than 240 others taken hostage. Since then, Israel's military campaign has killed more than 29,000 people in Gaza, according to the Palestinian territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

            "text": "UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The United States on Tuesday vetoed an Arab-backed and widely supported U.N. resolution demanding an immediate humanitarian cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war in the embattled Gaza Strip, saying it would interfere with negotiations on a deal to free hostages abducted in Israel.\n\n        The vote in the 15-member Security Council was 13-1 with the United Kingdom abstaining, reflecting the strong support from countries around the globe for ending the war, which started when Hamas militants invaded southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking 250 others hostage. Since then, more than 29,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s military offensive, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which says the vast majority were women and children.\n\n        It was the third U.S. veto of a Security Council resolution demanding a cease-fire in Gaza and came a day after the United States circulated a rival resolution that would support a temporary cease-fire linked to the release of all hostages.\n\n        Virtually every council member — including the United States — expressed concern at the impending catastrophe in Gaza’s southern city of Rafah, where some 1.5 million Palestinians have sought refuge, if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu goes ahead with his plan to evacuate civilians and move Israel’s military offensive to the area bordering Egypt, where Israel says Hamas fighters are hiding.\n\n        ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR\n        Workers inspect their office at a destroyed warehouse that was attacked on Monday by Israeli airstrikes, at an industrial district in the southern coastal town of Ghazieh, Lebanon, Tuesday, Feb. 20, 2024.

(AP Photo/Tsafrir Abayov)\n        US circulates rival UN resolution for temporary Gaza cease-fire after rejecting Arab proposal\n        Before the vote, Algeria’s U.N. Ambassador Amar Bendjama, the Arab representative on the council, said: “A vote in favor of this draft resolution is a support to the Palestinians right to life. Conversely, voting against it implies an endorsement of the brutal violence and collective punishment inflicted against them.”\n\n        U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield countered by saying the United States understands the desire for urgent action but believes the resolution would “negatively impact” sensitive negotiations on a hostage deal and a pause in fighting for at least six weeks. If that happens, “we can take the time to build a more enduring peace,” she said.\n\n        The proposed U.S. resolution, she said, “would do what this text does not — pressure Hamas to take the hostage deal that is on the table and help secure a pause that allows humanitarian assistance to reach Palestinian civilians in desperate need.”\n\n        She told reporters the Arab draft did not link the release of the hostages to a cease-fire, which would give Hamas a halt to fighting without requiring it to take any action. That would mean “that the fighting would have continued because without the hostage releases we know that the fighting is going to continue,” she said.\n\n        Israel’s U.N. Ambassador Gilad Erdan said the word cease-fire is used in the Security Council, the General Assembly and by U.N. officials “as if it is a silver bullet, a magical solution to all of the region’s problems.”\n\n        He called that “an absurd notion,” warning that a cease-fire in Gaza would enable Hamas to rearm and regroup and “their next attempted genocide against Israelis will only be a question of when, not if.”\n\n        Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian U.N. ambassador, shot back that the “message given today to Israel with this veto is that it can continue to get away with murder.”\n\n        He warned that more babies will be killed and orphaned, more children will die of hunger, cold and disease, more families will be threatened with further forced displacement, and Gaza’s entire 2.3 million population will be left without food, water, medicine and shelter.\n\n        And in a sharply critical message to the United States, Israel’s closest ally, Mansour said: “It means that human lives that could have been saved are instead being forsaken to Israel’s genocidal war machine, deliberately, knowingly, by those who oppose a cease-fire.”\n\n        What happens next remains to be seen.\n\n        The 22-nation Arab Group could take its resolution to the U.N. General Assembly, which includes all 193 U.N. member nations, where it is virtually certain to be approved. But unlike Security Council resolutions, assembly resolutions are not legally binding.\n\n        The Arab-backed resolution would have demanded an immediate humanitarian cease-fire to be respected by all parties, which implies an end to the war.\n\n        By contrast, the U.S. draft resolution would support a temporary cease-fire “as soon as practicable, based on the formula of all hostages being released,” and call for “lifting all barriers to the provision of humanitarian assistance at scale.”\n\n        It is the first time the U.S. has used the word “cease-fire,” as opposed to cessation of hostilities.\n\n        The Arab draft would also have demanded the immediate release of all hostages, rejected the forced displacement of Palestinian civilians and called for unhindered humanitarian access throughout Gaza.\n\n        Without naming either party, it would have condemned “all acts of terrorism” and reiterated the council’s “unwavering commitment” to a two-state solution with two democratic states, Israel and Palestine, living side-by-side in peace.\n\n        In measures sure to anger Israel — and reinforce differences and tensions between U.S. President Joe Biden and Israel’s Netanyahu — the U.S. draft resolution reiterates the same unwavering commitment to a two-state solution, which the Israeli leader opposes.\n\n        Biden has repeatedly called on Israel to protect Palestinian civilians, and the draft resolution says Israel’s planned major ground offensive in Rafah “should not proceed under current circumstances.”\n\n        In another criticism directed at Israel, the U.S. draft “condemns calls by government ministers for the resettlement of Gaza and rejects an attempt at demographic or territorial change in Gaza that would violate international law.”\n\n        Thomas-Greenfield said the United States was not setting a deadline for a vote on its proposed resolution\n\n        Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia accused the United States of “duplicitous and hypocritical calls” for the council to wait for diplomacy to produce results on a hostage deal.\n\n        “It could not yield any results because the real goal of Washington is not to achieve peace in the Middle East, not to protect civilians, but rather to advance their geopolitical agenda, demanding at any cost for their closest Middle East ally to be shielded,” Nebenzia told the council, claiming that the U.S. has given “an effective license for Israel to kill Palestinians.”\n\n        While this was the third U.S. veto of a Security Council resolution demanding an immediate cease-fire, the council has adopted two resolutions on Gaza where the U.S. abstained.\n\n        Its first resolution, on Nov. 15, called for humanitarian pauses to address the escalating crisis for Palestinian civilians. In late November, a seven-day pause led to the release of 120 hostages held by Hamas in exchange for Israel’s release of 200 Palestinian prisoners.\n\n        On Dec. 22, the council adopted a watered-down resolution calling for immediately speeding aid deliveries to desperate civilians in Gaza, but without the original plea for an “urgent suspension of hostilities” between Israel and Hamas.\n\n        It did call for “creating the conditions for a sustainable cessation of hostilities.” The steps were not defined, but diplomats said it was the council’s first reference to stopping fighting. Because of ongoing fighting and no new humanitarian pause, little aid has gotten into Gaza.",

However, after the devastating infrastructure effects of Hurricane Hilary in August 2023, and the ongoing storms in the area, half of those funds were allocated to deferred maintenance before any type of expansion could happen, according memos obtained by The San Diego Union-Tribune.\n\n        Mayor Aguirre and other state politicians, including Gov. Gavin Newsom, have asked Congress for an additional $310 million in federal funds to address the issue, but it has yet to be approved.\n\n        \"It's challenging to maintain the attention and focus that this emergency needs when we're located 3,000 miles away,\" Aguirre said of requesting federal intervention from Washington, D.C.\n\n        \"We also need additional intervention from our state administration. Our governor has advocated for that supplemental funding request, but he has fallen short of declaring a state of emergency,\" Aguirre added.\n\n        In Dec. 2023, the International Boundary and Water Commission announced the Rehabilitation and Expansion Progressive Design-Build project for the International Wastewater Treatment Plant. The project includes essential rehabilitation of existing infrastructure and expansion of the plant, according to the press release.\n\n        \"We have participated in many public meetings in the affected areas and want to assure residents our priority is improving the health and welfare of communities on both sides of the border,\" Frank Fisher, Public Affairs Chief for the International Boundary and Water Commission, told ABC News in a statement.",

            "text": "Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey came out Friday in support of planned legislation that would protect IVF statewide, following the State Supreme Court ruling that frozen embryos are \"children\" and in vitro fertilization treatments.\n\n\"Following the ruling from the Alabama Supreme Court, I said that in our state, we work to foster a culture of life,\" IVey said in a statement. \"This certainly includes some couples hoping and praying to be parents who utilize IVF. Republican colleague in the Legislature Senator Tim Melson, along with Senate and House members, are working on a solution to ensure we protect these families and life itself.\"\n\nMelson, who chairs the Senate's Health Care Committee, said Thursday that he is planning to introduce legislation that would clarify that embryos are not viable unless they are implanted in a uterus.\n\nIn its decision, the State Supreme Court gave frozen embryos the same rights as children. The court ruling came in a lawsuit by couples whose frozen embryos were accidentally destroyed in a clinic. The judges ruled that the states laws concerning wrongful deaths of minors do not exclude \"extrauterine children.\"\n\nThe judges urged the state Legislature to clarify Alabama law, which holds that life begins at conception.\n\n\"They just read the bill, and the way it's written, it's like if you're going to say from conception, it's life, which I do believe it is. But it's not a viable life until it's implanted in the uterus,\" Melson said about Friday's ruling.\n\nMelson, who is also a medical doctor, says his proposal would make clear that \"a human egg that is fertilized in vitro shall be considered a potential life,\" but should not be legally considered a human life until it is implanted in a uterus.\"\n\nGovernor Ivey said in a statement that she wants to support couples hoping to get pregnant using IVF.\n\n\"Republican colleague in the Legislature Senator Tim Melson, along with Senate and House members, are working on a solution to ensure we protect these families and life itself,\" she said.\n\nFertility clinics in Alabama are anxiously waiting for the Legislature to act, and at least three of them have put IVF treatment on hold or restricted their services. The University of Alabama at Birmingham health system, the state's largest hospital, said it is also halting some IVF services.\n\n\"This is a huge, huge issue that affects so many families, and so many patients throughout the nation that we are very hopeful that there are dedicated, very intelligent, motivated legislatures that will help us with this process,\" said Dr. Beth Malizia with Alabama Fertility, which runs three clinics in Alabama.\n\nThey have halted all new IVF treatment due to potential legal risks.\n\nThe Center for Reproductive Medicine in Mobile, the clinic at the center of the Supreme Court lawsuit, has also halted IVF services. \"The recent Alabama Supreme Court decision has sadly left us with no choice but to pause IVF treatments for patients,\" it said in a statement.\n\n\"We are considered a pro-life state. But what's so ironic about that is there's not anything a lot more pro-life than a fertility practice trying to help couples who can't conceive, conceive a baby, \" said Dr. Brett Davenport, with Fertility Institute of North Alabama, which has not curtailed services.\n\nAlabama's Supreme Court ruling has reverberated across the U.S.\n\nPresident Biden tied it directly to the U.S. Supreme Court decision in 2022 that ended the federal right to an abortion: \"Make no mistake: this is a direct result of the overturning of Roe v. Wade.\" Speaking Thursday in Grand Rapids, Mich. Vice President Kamala Harris said, \"So on the one hand, the proponents are saying that an individual doesn't have a right to end an unwanted pregnancy. And on the other hand, the individual does not have a right to start a family. And the hypocrisy abounds.\"\n\nAlabama Democrats have introduced a bill that also makes it clear that an embryo outside a womb would not be considered a human child, but they are in the minority in the state legislature.\n\nMelson, a Republican, hopes his legislation will pass quickly so that Alabama's IVF clinics can continue to operate.\n\n\"This issue is one that I've heard from several infertility clinics, and they're anxious to get it out and have the ability to go back to functioning,\" he said.",

            "text": "Some fertility clinics and shipping services plan to hold off on sending frozen embryos from Alabama to other states as they weigh the legal implications of an Alabama court ruling that says embryos created through in vitro fertilization are children.\n\nMany doctors and patients are confused about which elements of fertility treatment are restricted, following the Alabama Supreme Court decision last week, and at least three Alabama providers have paused IVF services. Some IVF patients have considered moving their embryos out of the state to continue the process elsewhere, only to learn that the option isn't available to them right now.\n\nRESOLVE: The National Infertility Association announced Friday that nationwide embryo shipping services have indicated that they will stop transporting embryos to and from Alabama.\n\n\"This slight window of hope for Alabamans currently undergoing IVF to continue their family-building treatment in other states just slammed shut,\" RESOLVE CEO Barbara Collura said in a statement.\n\nAt least two IVF providers in Alabama told NBC News they have paused shipping of embryos, as well.\n\nThe University of Alabama at Birmingham, which suspended IVF services this week, said Thursday that it is not sending embryos to new locations for now.\n\n“We understand some patients wish to transport their embryos to another facility,” UAB said in a statement. “Companies that transport embryos are also assessing the risks associated with the Alabama Supreme Court ruling, and we are working to identify a company that is able and willing as soon as possible. It is our goal to help patients who are interested in this option do so safely, but — at this time — there are no options available.”\n\nMeghan Cole, a patient at Alabama Fertility in Birmingham, was expecting her embryo to be implanted in a surrogate Friday (Cole has a blood disorder that prevents her from safely carrying a pregnancy). But the appointment was canceled Wednesday night after the clinic decided to pause IVF services.\n\nShe inquired about transferring her embryos to an out-of-state facility, but a doctor told her that the practice was worried it would be liable for any potential damage to the embryos during transit, she said.\n\n“Now, even if I wanted to get them out of the state and do a transfer in another state or where my surrogate lives, I can’t,” Cole said. “I’m just kind of stuck until something changes down here, which who knows how long that’s going to take?”\n\nAlabama Fertility did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nDr. Brett Davenport, a reproductive endocrinologist at Fertility Institute of North Alabama, said that even though his practice is continuing IVF services, it isn't shipping embryos, either.\n\nRecommended\n\nLATINO\nLatino patients with respiratory illnesses are 5 times more likely to be oversedated\n\nHEALTH NEWS\nThree Alabama clinics pauses IVF services after court rules that embryos are children\n\"I’m not actively destroying embryos, nor am I transporting embryos out of state, just because I think that this is very possibly going to be resolved in about a month,\" he said.\n\nThe Alabama court found that people can be held legally responsible for the destruction of embryos under the state’s Wrongful Death Act, which says that an unjustified or negligent act that leads to someone’s death is a civil offense. So providers of IVF services and embryo transport now fear legal repercussions if embryos are discarded — a common part of the IVF process, since some embryos can have genetic abnormalities or may no longer be needed.\n\nHowever, the Alabama Supreme Court's Feb. 16 ruling applied to a unique circumstance: Three couples sued a fertility clinic in Mobile, Alabama, after a person wandered into an unlocked storage area and dropped frozen embryos on the floor. The court ruled that because an embryo is considered a person, the clinic’s failure to secure that storage area violated the state’s Wrongful Death Act.\n\nLegal experts are hesitant to speculate on the broader implications.\n\n\"Parents of an embryo that is destroyed can sue the person who destroyed the embryo for wrongful death — that's all this decision said. We'll have to wait and see what may play out later on in the courts if there are subsequent lawsuits seeking to weaponize this opinion to ban IVF,\" said Gail Deady, senior staff attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights.\n\nOn Friday, Katherine Robertson, chief counsel for Alabama Attorney General Steven Marshall, said her office “has no intention of using the recent Alabama Supreme Court decision as a basis for prosecuting IVF families or providers.”\n\nThe Alabama Legislature could also act to protect IVF. Five Democrats introduced a bill in the Alabama House of Representatives on Thursday that stipulates that embryos outside of a uterus are neither unborn children nor human beings under state law. Republican state Sen. Tim Melson also announced Thursday that he plans to introduce a similar bill clarifying that embryos aren't human lives until they're implanted in the uterus.\n\nIt's not clear when fertility clinics might feel comfortable enough to resume normal operations — or whether patients who intended to discard embryos will have to continue paying storage fees in the interim. Storing frozen embryos can cost $350 to $1,000 per year.\n\nCole said she's sympathetic to her clinic's position, but she's also worried about the potential for spiraling implications of the Alabama ruling.\n\n\"The clinic is afraid to even release the embryos to us for transfer to another state. I’m like, ‘Well, theoretically, aren’t you kidnapping my children?’\" she said. \"How far are we taking this? Can I claim them as dependents on my tax return?”",

            "text": "WASHINGTON, Feb 23 (Reuters) - The United States on Friday imposed extensive sanctions against Russia, targeting more than 500 people and entities to mark the second anniversary of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine and retaliate for the death of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny.\nPresident Joe Biden said the measures aim to ensure Russian President Vladimir Putin \"pays an even steeper price for his aggression abroad and repression at home.\"\nThe sanctions targeted Russia's Mir payment system, financial institutions and its military industrial base, sanctions evasion, future energy production and other areas. They also hit prison officials the U.S. says are linked to Navalny's death.\n\"Doesn’t Washington realize that sanctions won’t take us down?\" Russia's ambassador to Washington, Anatoly Antonov, was quoted as saying on his embassy's channel on the Telegram messaging app.\nThe Biden administration is seeking to continue supporting Ukraine as the country faces acute shortages of ammunition and the approval of more U.S. military aid has been delayed for months in the U.S. Congress. The European Union, Britain and Canada also took action against Russia on Friday.\nHowever, Russia's export-focused $2.2-trillion economy has proved more resilient to two years of unprecedented sanctions than either Moscow or the West anticipated. Russia invaded neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022 and the war has seen tens of thousands killed and cities destroyed.\nThe U.S. Treasury Department targeted nearly 300 people and entities on Friday, while the State Department hit over 250 people and entities and the Commerce Department added over 90 companies to the Entity List.\nThe United States and its allies have imposed sanctions on thousands of Russian targets in the past two years.\n\"We must sustain our support for Ukraine even as we weaken Russia's war machine. It's critical that Congress steps up to join our allies around the world in giving Ukraine the means to defend itself,\" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement.\nBrian O'Toole, a former Treasury official, said the action, while a lot of names, was short on impact.\n\"They're not going to have a big impact,\" O'Toole said, because the majority of the entities listed are Russian, rather than foreign firms, and are easily replaceable as Moscow seeks to skirt sanctions.\nBut Ben Harris, a former senior Treasury official, said the magnitude of the sanctions imposed by the United States alone was formidable.\nPeter Harrell, a former National Security Council official, said the moves against sanctions evasion networks in third countries sent a clear message that the U.S. is prepared to take action against circumvention.\n\"I see this as kind of a valuable but incremental step that is within the strategy they've been deploying over the last two years,\" he said.\nPAYMENT SYSTEM\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday's move was Washington's largest number of designations in a single Russia action.\nThe U.S. Treasury imposed sanctions on state-owned National Payment Card System, the operator of the Mir payment system.\nMir payments cards have become more important since its U.S. rivals suspended operations in Russia after Moscow sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine, and their payment cards which were issued in the country stopped working abroad.\n\"The Government of Russia's proliferation of Mir has permitted Russia to build out a financial infrastructure that enables Russian efforts to evade sanctions,\" the U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement.\nIt also targeted over a dozen Russian banks, investment firms, venture capital funds, and fintech companies.\nThe United States also targeted Russia's future energy production and exports, taking further aim at Arctic LNG 2 project in Siberia. In November, Washington imposed sanctions on a major entity involved in the massive project.\nOn Friday, the State Department targeted Russia's Zvezda shipbuilding company, which it said is involved in the construction of up to 15 highly specialized LNG tankers intended for use in support of Arctic LNG 2 exports.\nU.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo told reporters that Treasury plans to level additional sanctions later on Friday over the G7's price cap on Russian oil. He said the measures will increase costs for Russia to use an aging fleet of tankers to get oil to markets mainly in India and China.\nThe United States also imposed sanctions on entities based in China, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Kazakhstan and Liechtenstein over the evasion of Western sanctions on Russia and backfilling.\nThe action comes as Washington has increasingly sought to crack down on Russia's circumvention of its measures.\nThe move also targeted a network through which Russia, in cooperation with Iran, has acquired and produced drones.\nThe Biden administration also imposed new trade restrictions on 93 entities from Russia, China, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and elsewhere for supporting Russia's war effort in Ukraine.\nNAVALNY'S DEATH\nThe State Department on Friday also targeted three Russian Federal Penitentiary Service officials it accused of being connected to Navalny's death, including its deputy director who it said reportedly instructed prison staff to exert harsher treatment on Navalny.\nNavalny, 47, fell unconscious and died suddenly last week at the penal colony above the Arctic Circle, the prison service said.\nBiden, who has directly blamed Putin for Navalny's death, met the opposition leader's widow and daughter in California on Thursday and called him \"a man of incredible courage.\"\nThe U.S. action also targeted people involved in what the State Department called the forcible transfer or deportation of Ukrainian children.\nRussia's economy has performed above expectations, with the International Monetary Fund in January forecasting, opens new tab 2.6 GDP growth for 2024 - a 1.5 percentage point upgrade from an October estimate - after solid 3.0 growth in 2023.\n\"Russia’s current GDP numbers are not self-sustaining economic growth that's putting the Russian economy on a trajectory for a more prosperous future. It's wartime spending that is consuming the future to serve the present war,\" a State Department official said.",

            "text": "Jerusalem\nCNN\n— \nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu unveiled a plan for Gaza’s future post-Hamas, which includes the “complete demilitarization” of the enclave, closing off the territory’s southern border with Egypt, as well as the overhaul of Gaza’s civil administration and education systems.\n\nCNN has obtained a copy of the plan, which Netanyahu presented to members of Israel’s security cabinet Thursday night. It was distributed as a basis for discussion, the prime minister’s office told CNN, in preparation of further talks, and comes after Netanyahu faced weeks of criticism for having no concrete plan for a postwar Gaza.\n\nA crowded street in Rafah, where many displaced Palestinians have trekked as the IDF's ground campaign moved south through Gaza.\nRELATED ARTICLE\nNetanyahu directs Israeli military to draw up plan to evacuate more than one million people from Rafah as offensive looms\nThe plan comes as Israel sent a negotiating team, led by Mossad Director David Barnea, to Paris on Friday to pursue talks over a potential ceasefire and hostage release deal that may put an end to the four-month long war.\n\nMore than 29,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the war began, according to the ministry of health in the enclave. Hamas’ October 7 attack killed 1,200 people in Israel, according to Israeli authorities.\n\nA number of principles are outlined in the document, from changes on the security and civil levels to more long-term plans about who governs the territory.\n\nOn the security file, the envisioned plan includes Israel closing off Gaza’s southern border with Egypt, giving Israel complete control of entry and exit from the enclave. At present, Egypt controls access to and from Gaza’s southern border via the Rafah crossing.\n\nNetanyahu’s plan says Israel will cooperate “as much as possible” with Egypt, in coordination with the United States.\n\nIt is not clear whether Israel has obtained Egypt’s sign-off on that element of the plan, or any part of it. But an Israeli official told CNN that the plan was “aligned” with the US.\n\nThere has been no immediate official US reaction to the proposal.\n\nThe plan asserts, as Netanyahu has said before, that “Israel will have security control over the entire area west of Jordan,” which includes all of the West Bank and Israel, as well as Gaza.\n\nThe Palestinians have long sought an independent state in the occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza.\n\nIsrael will be responsible for “realizing and overseeing” the demilitarization of the Strip, the plan says, except for what is required to maintain public order.\n\nAn aerial view of buildings destroyed by Israeli air strikes in the Jabalia camp for Palestinian refugees in Gaza City, the Gaza Strip on October 11.\nAn aerial view of buildings destroyed by Israeli air strikes in the Jabalia camp for Palestinian refugees in Gaza City, the Gaza Strip on October 11. Yahya Hassouna/AFP/Getty Images\nOn the civil level, Netanyahu details an overhaul of Gaza’s civil administration and education systems, including an apparent cut-off of funding from Qatar to Gaza – which a previous Netanyahu government approved and facilitated.\n\nThe local entities running the civil service “will not be identified with countries or entities that support terrorism and will not receive payment from them,” the plan says.\n\nWhile it is likely a reference to Qatar, it is not clear if it would also apply to the Palestinian Authority, a revitalized version of which the US has said should run Gaza in the future.\n\nTOPSHOT - This aerial picture shows abandoned and torched vehicles at the site of the October 7 attack on the Supernova desert music Festival by Palestinian militants near Kibbutz Reim in the Negev desert in southern Israel on October 13, 2023. One month after Israel was wracked by Hamas attacks, life has been upended for both the Palestinians and Israel after it launched a war of reprisal in the Gaza Strip. The October 7 attacks by Hamas militants who stormed across from Gaza and struck kibbutzim and southern Israeli areas killed 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and deeply scarred the nation. The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza says nearly 9,500 have been killed, two-thirds of them women and children, and mostly civilians. (Photo by Jack GUEZ / AFP) (Photo by JACK GUEZ/AFP via Getty Images)\nRELATED ARTICLE\nIsrael releases names and details of alleged involvement of UNRWA employees in October 7 attacks\nThe Netanyahu plan also calls for “de-radicalization” in the education system, which Israel and its allies have long accused of promoting antisemitism and hatred of Israel.\n\nThe plan repeats that Israel will work to shut down UNRWA, the main United Nations agency supporting Palestinian refugees, and work to replace it “with responsible international aid agencies.”\n\nIsrael accuses about a dozen UNRWA employees of being directly involved in the October 7 Hamas attack. The agency employs about 13,000 people in Gaza.\n\nFinally, the plan reiterates Israel’s insistence that it will not be forced by the international community to recognize a Palestinian state, a possibility the United Kingdom and US President Joe Biden have begun to float.\n\n“Israel outright rejects international dictates regarding a permanent settlement with the Palestinians,” the Netanyahu outline says, asserting that recognition of a Palestinian state now would be “a huge reward to unprecedented terrorism.”\n\nIs the plan realistic?\nMany of the proposals are opposed by key parties. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has already rejected the idea of a buffer zone. Egypt has rejected the suggestion that Israel could control its border with Gaza. And the United Arab Emirates has said that without a clear roadmap towards an independent Palestinian State – ruled out by Netanyahu – it won’t help foot the bill for Gaza’s reconstruction.\n\nNetanyahu’s vow to eliminate UNRWA, the UN aid agency that supplies most international aid to Gaza, would have been difficult to achieve even before October 7. Now, as the UN warns that almost all of the population of Gaza is at risk of “imminent famine,” the task would be enormous.\n\nThere is no mention in the plan of the Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the occupied West Bank. Netanyahu has previously rejected the suggestion that it could take control of Gaza. It is not clear whether he would now accept a reconstituted version taking over – and it is far from clear this would be accepted by Palestinians, more of whom voted for Hamas in elections in 2006.\n\nFor now, Netanyahu’s priority remains destroying Hamas and returning more than 100 hostages kidnapped on October 7 who remain in Gaza; getting hostage talks back on track is a key goal of the top delegation that Netanyahu sent to Paris on Friday. The US and others hope a deal will forestall a ground operation in Rafah that could push the death toll in Gaza to well above 30,000.\n\nMost observers believe that once the war is over, elections in Israel are inevitable, which Netanayhu and his allies are predicted to lose. But it is far from clear that a different leader – war cabinet member and former opposition leader Benny Gantz is touted as the favorite – would have much of a different vision for Gaza.",

The Kremlin has also managed to keep its arsenals stocked, resorting to sourcing some weapons from Iran and North Korea -- two countries that are also heavily sanctioned by the West.\n\n\"[Vladimir Putin] and his tricksters have found a lot of ways to evade sanctions,\" Nuland conceded. \"That is why when you see this package that we're going to launch in a couple days, it is very heavily focused on evasion, on nodes and networks and countries that help evade -- willingly or otherwise -- and on the banks that support and allow that kind of evasion.\"\n\nNuland also predicted the administration would also impose additional penalties tied to Navalny's death in the future.\n\n\"I anticipate as time goes on we will be able to put forward more and more sanctions on folks directly responsible for Navalny's death,\" she said.\n\nThe U.K. announced its own sanctions against six Russian officials on Wednesday.\n\n\"History is watching.

            "text": "President Joe Biden on Friday announced more than 500 new sanctions on Russia and its war machine in the largest tranche of penalties since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine nearly two years ago. Biden followed through on a promise to further punish Russian President Vladimir Putin one week after opposition leader Alexei Navalny died in a Siberian prison. The sanctions — as well as those added Friday by the European Union — come one day before the second anniversary of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\n                “The American people and people around the world understand that the stakes of this fight extend far beyond Ukraine,” Biden said in a statement announcing the sanctions. “If Putin does not pay the price for his death and destruction, he will keep going. And the costs to the United States — along with our NATO Allies and partners in Europe and around the world — will rise.”\n\n                The bulk of the sanctions were already in the works for the invasion anniversary, though a few were added this week to target those involved in Navalny’s death at an Arctic penal colony. Biden met Thursday with Navalny’s widow and daughter in San Francisco and praised her late husband’s bravery.\n\n                Biden: 'Putin is responsible for Navalny's death'\n\n                SharePlay Video\n                “Russia’s financial sector, defense industrial base, procurement networks and sanctions evaders across multiple continents,” Biden said. “They will ensure Putin pays an even steeper price for his aggression abroad and repression at home.”\n\n                The Treasury Department will impose additional price cap sanctions that will make it more costly for Russia to get around sanctions, Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo told reporters in a Thursday night call previewing the sanctions. He touted the Biden administration’s price cap on Russian oil, saying that the Kremlin has invested money on trying to adapt to the sanctions and evade them.\n\n                In December, POLITICO reported that Moscow has been successful in skirting some oil sanctions imposed by G7 nations and the European Union.\n\n                New sanctions will also target Russian companies and third-country providers that help with Russia’s military efforts, making it harder for the Kremlin to purchase the goods it needs to build weapons for its war against Ukraine, Adeyemo added.\n\n                “Putin thought that turning inward would be enough to insulate his defense industry from the reach of our tools. But the truth is Russia still can’t make everything it needs for the battlefield,” Adeyemo said.\n\n                The Treasury Department has engaged in “intensive diplomacy” to convey to bad actors the consequences of helping to sustain Russia’s war: “Early signs have been promising, with Russia more financially isolated than ever before,” Adeyemo said.\n\n                Later Friday morning, the State Department unveiled additional sanctions specifically in response to Navalny’s death, which include sanctioning three individuals in connection with his death at the Siberian penal colony: the prison warden, the regional prison head and the deputy director of Russia’s federal prison service.\n\n                In addition to those, State is also sanctioning more than 250 entities and individuals who have evaded previous sanctions and bolstered Moscow’s future energy and metals and mining production, the department said in a statement. Several people also faced imposed sanctions and visa restrictions for the transfer or deportation of Ukrainian children during the war.\n\n                Biden, after meeting with Putin at a 2021 summit, had promised “devastating” consequences for Russia if the imprisoned opposition leader were to die. But nearly three years later, the Biden administration had already exhausted many of its tools to punish Russia – and Putin had managed to somewhat mitigate the damage felt to his nation’s economy.\n\n                The White House’s larger focus remains pushing House Republicans to advance a $95 billion Senate-approved supplemental funding measure that includes additional military aid for Ukraine. Biden, in his Friday statement, again urged the bill to pass.\n\n                Further delays, the administration has argued, will only continue to weaken Ukraine’s position on the battlefield. After retaking some of the territory Russia initially seized after its invasion two years ago, the conflict has bogged down over the past 12 months. Ukraine is in strong defensive positions across the country’s eastern flank, but as arms supplies dwindle, Russia is gaining ground.\n\n                The European Union announced Friday that it is imposing sanctions on several foreign companies over allegations that they have exported dual-use goods to Russia that could be used in its war against Ukraine. It also announced penalties for individuals involved in the kidnapping of Ukrainian children.",

            "text": "Elon Musk is suing OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman, saying the company behind ChatGPT has diverged from its original, nonprofit mission by partnering with Microsoft for $13 billion and keeping its code for its newest generative AI products a secret.\n\nMusk, who co-founded OpenAI in 2015, has since left and has formed his own AI company, xAI. His complaint, filed Thursday in California state court, said that company and its partnership with Microsoft violated OpenAI’s founding charter, representing a breach of contract. Musk is asking for a jury trial and for the company, Altman and co-founder Greg Brockman to pay back the profit they received from the business.\n\nOpenAI was founded as a check on what the founders believed was a serious threat artificial generative intelligence, or AGI, posed to humanity. The company created a board of overseers to review any product the company created and its products’ code was made public.\n\nBut Altman, Brockman and Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever in 2019 formed OpenAI LP, a for-profit entity that exists within the larger company’s structure. That for-profit company took OpenAI from worthless to a valuation of $90 billion in just a few years — and Altman is largely credited as the mastermind of that plan and the key to the company’s success.\n\nOpenAI did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n\nThe lawsuit also cites a high-profile leadership crisis last year that led to Altman’s temporary ouster from the company, apparently over concerns by several board members about the risks of artificial intelligence. After days of uncertainty and an intervention by Microsoft, Altman was restored to his position in what industry analysts said was a victory for those seeking to commercialize AI technology.\n\nThursday’s lawsuit repeats that claim.\n\n“The public is still in the dark regarding what exactly the Board’s ‘deliberative review process’ revealed that resulted in the initial firing of Mr. Altman,” the complaint said. “However, one thing is clear to Mr. Musk and the public at large: OpenAI has abandoned its ‘irrevocable’ non-profit mission in the pursuit of profit.”\n\nAlthough Microsoft — which has invested billions of dollars into OpenAI and which has a close partnership with the startup — is not named as a defendant in Musk’s suit, the tech giant appears 68 times in the complaint.\n\nMuch of the lawsuit takes issue with Microsoft’s apparent influence over OpenAI and Microsoft’s economic position. Musk has previously threatened to sue Microsoft and accused it of stealing content from X, Musk’s social media company, to train Microsoft AI tools.\n\n“OpenAI, Inc. has been transformed into a closed-source de facto subsidiary of the largest technology company in the world: Microsoft,” Thursday’s lawsuit said. “Under its new Board, it is not just developing but is actually refining an AGI to maximize profits for Microsoft.”\n\nMusk, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO, left OpenAI in 2018. He has continued to speak out against the dangers of artificial intelligence. In the complaint, he framed the current OpenAI leaders as greedy.\n\n“Where some like Mr. Musk see an existential threat in AGI, others see AGI as a source of profit and power,” the complaint stated.",

            "text": "Elon Musk has sued OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman, claiming that the company failed to keep its promise of developing AI tools for \"the benefit of humanity\" over maximizing profits.\n\nMusk helped launch and fund OpenAI in its early years. His lawyers argue that Musk poured time, money and recruiting resources to the AI lab, which was established in 2015, on the condition that it would remain a nonprofit \"dedicated to creating safe, open-source AGI for public benefit,\" referring to artificial general intelligence — the point at which machines surpass the capabilities of the human brain.\n\nThe suit, which was filed Thursday in Superior Court in San Francisco, accuses OpenAI, Altman and the company's president Greg Brockman of breaking their agreement with Musk by abandoning those founding principles over the years.\n\nThe Tesla CEO is asking the court to order OpenAI, which is now backed by Microsoft, to make its research and technology available to public, as well as prohibit the company's executives and Microsoft from receiving any financial gain from its work.\n\nMusk is also seeking damages, though the amount is unclear. Musk's lawyers say any compensation from the suit will be given to a nonprofit or charity.\n\nOpenAI declined to comment.\n\nMusk's lawsuit scrutinizing OpenAI's founding ethos taps into criticism the company has faced since the release of ChatGPT propelled the company's profile and attracted billions of dollars in outside investment.\n\nOpenAI's structure is unusual for a tech company.\n\nA nonprofit board oversees its for-profit arm, which at times can create tension over how quickly to commercialize products. The at-times dueling sides were on display last year when Altman was abruptly ousted then brought back to the company.\n\nThe drama was partially fueled by the fear that OpenAI was sidestepping safety concerns by publicly releasing new AI products too quickly. Altman has denied this.\n\nThere have been calls for OpenAI to dissolve its nonprofit side, but the unorthodox structure remains in place.\n\nAccording to the suit, Altman approached Musk in 2015 out of shared concerns over the risks of AI and specifically, the AI research lab owned by Google known as DeepMind.\n\nAfter all parties agreed that OpenAI would be nonprofit and open-sourced, Musk contributed more than $44 million to the ChatGPT maker between 2016 and 2020, the suit says.\n\nMusk's lawyers also describe him as \"instrumental\" to OpenAI's recruiting efforts, including the hiring of Ilya Sutskever, who left Google to be the chief scientist at OpenAI.\n\nIn 2018, Musk stepped down as co-chair of OpenAI, though the suit says he continued to contribute to the company and regularly received updates about the company from Altman, Sutskever and Brockman.\n\nThe complaint argues that the company went wayward in recent years after decisions to create a for-profit subsidiary, give Microsoft an exclusive license to some of its technology, and keeping secret the internal design of ChatGPT's latest version.\n\n\"OpenAI Inc. has been transformed into a closed-source de facto subsidiary of the largest technology company, Microsoft,\" accoridng to the suit.\n\nOpenAI and Altman have been thrown into turmoil repeatedly since the company's chatbot made its public debut in November 2022.\n\nMusk has been openly part of the backlash. Last year, he told then-Fox News host Tucker Carlson that ChatGPT has a liberal bias, and he planned to provide an alternative.\n\nIn July, Musk launched his own AI startup called xAI to create AI tools that \"assist humanity in its quest for understanding and knowledge.\"\n\nMusk's company offers a limited number of users in the U.S. the opportunity to try the prototype and provide feedback, though early access requires a paid subscription to another Musk company, X, formerly known as Twitter.",

However, the Musk Foundation has failed in recent years to give away the minimum required, the Times reported.\n\nIn 2021, the Musk Foundation fell $41 million short of the minimum required donation, and in 2022 it missed the 5% required donation by $193 million, tax filings show, per the paper.\n\nThe Musk Foundation has not reported what it gave away in 2023.\n\nAccording to the Times, if it did not address the shortfall from the previous year, it could incur a penalty tax amounting to 30% of the remaining shortfall from 2022.\n\nThe paper contrasted Musk's philanthropic activities with fellow billionaire Bill Gates, whose charitable foundation is the second largest in the world and has had major global impact.\n\n\"The really striking thing about Musk is the disjuncture between his outsized public persona, and his very, very minimal philanthropic presence,\" Benjamin Soskis, who studies philanthropy at the Urban Institute, told The Times.\n\nSoskis noted that Musk's foundation lacks \"any direction or any real focus, outside his business ventures.\"",

            "text": "OpenAI is reinstating CEO Sam Altman to its board of directors and said it has “full confidence” in his leadership after the conclusion of an outside investigation into the company’s turmoil.\n\nThe ChatGPT maker tapped the law firm WilmerHale to look into what led the company to abruptly fire Altman in November, only to rehire him days later. After months of investigation, it found that Altman’s ouster was a “consequence of a breakdown in the relationship and loss of trust” between him and the prior board, OpenAI said in a summary of the findings Friday. It did not release the full report.\n\nOpenAI also announced it has added three women to its board of directors: Dr. Sue Desmond-Hellman, a former CEO of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; Nicole Seligman, a former Sony general counsel; and Instacart CEO Fidji Simo.\n\nThe actions are a way for the San Francisco-based artificial intelligence company to show investors and customers that it is trying to move past the internal conflicts that nearly destroyed it last year and made global headlines.\n\n“I’m pleased this whole thing is over,” Altman told reporters Friday, adding that he’s been disheartened to see “people with an agenda” leaking information to try to harm the company or its mission and “pit us against each other.” At the same time, he said he’s learned from the experience and apologized for a dispute with a former board member he could have handled “with more grace and care.”\n\nIn a parting shot, two board members who voted to fire Altman before getting pushed out themselves wished the new board well but said accountability is paramount when building technology “as potentially world-changing” as what OpenAI is pursuing.\n\n“We hope the new board does its job in governing OpenAI and holding it accountable to the mission,” said a joint statement from ex-board members Helen Toner and Tasha McCauley. “As we told the investigators, deception, manipulation, and resistance to thorough oversight should be unacceptable.”\n\nFor more than three months, OpenAI said little about what led its then-board of directors to fire Altman on Nov. 17. An announcement that day said Altman was “not consistently candid in his communications” in a way that hindered the board’s ability to exercise its responsibilities. He also was kicked off the board, along with its chairman, Greg Brockman, who responded by quitting his job as the company’s president.\n\nMuch of OpenAI’s conflicts have been rooted in its unusual governance structure. Founded as a nonprofit with a mission to safely build futuristic AI that helps humanity, it is now a fast-growing big business still controlled by a nonprofit board bound to its original mission.\n\nThe investigation found the prior board acted within its discretion. But it also determined that Altman’s “conduct did not mandate removal,” OpenAI said. It said both Altman and Brockman remained the right leaders for the company.\n\n“The review concluded there was a significant breakdown in trust between the prior board, and Sam and Greg,” Bret Taylor, the board’s chair, told reporters Friday. “And similarly concluded that the board acted in good faith, that the board believed at the time that its actions would mitigate some of the challenges that it perceived and didn’t anticipate some of the instability.”\n\nThe dangers posed by increasingly powerful AI systems have long been a subject of debate among OpenAI’s founders and leaders. But citing the law firm’s findings, Taylor said Altman’s firing “did not arise out of concerns regarding product safety or security.”\n\nNor was it about OpenAI’s finances or any statements made to investors, customers or business partners, Taylor said.\n\nDays after his surprise ouster, Altman and his supporters — with backing from most of OpenAI’s workforce and close business partner Microsoft — helped orchestrate a comeback that brought Altman and Brockman back to their executive roles and forced out board members Toner, a Georgetown University researcher; McCauley, a scientist at the RAND Corporation; and another co-founder, Ilya Sutskever. Sutskever kept his job as chief scientist and publicly expressed regret for his role in ousting Altman.\n\n“I think Ilya loves OpenAI,” Altman said Friday, saying he hopes they will keep working together but declining to answer a question about Sutskever’s current position at the company.\n\nAltman and Brockman did not regain their board seats when they rejoined the company in November. But an “initial” new board of three men was formed, led by Taylor, a former Salesforce and Facebook executive who also chaired Twitter’s board before Elon Musk took over the platform. The others are former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and Quora CEO Adam D’Angelo, the only member of the previous board to stay on.\n\nAfter it retained the law firm in December, OpenAI said WilmerHale conducted dozens of interviews with the company’s prior board, current executives, advisers and other witnesses. The company also said the law firm reviewed thousands of documents and other corporate actions. WilmerHale didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.\n\nThe board said it will also be making “improvements” to the company’s governance structure. It said it will adopt new corporate governance guidelines, strengthen the company’s policies around conflicts of interest, create a whistleblower hotline that will allow employees and contractors to submit anonymous reports and establish additional board committees.\n\nThe company still has other troubles to contend with, including a lawsuit filed by Musk, who helped bankroll the early years of OpenAI and was a co-chair of its board after its 2015 founding. Musk alleges that the company is betraying its founding mission in pursuit of profits.\n\nLegal experts have expressed doubt about whether Musk’s arguments, centered around an alleged breach of contract, will hold up in court.\n\nBut it has already forced open the company’s internal conflicts about its unusual governance structure, how “open” it should be about its research and how to pursue what’s known as artificial general intelligence, or AI systems that can perform just as well as — or even better than — humans in a wide variety of tasks.\n\nTaylor said Friday that OpenAI’s “mission-driven nonprofit” structure won’t be changing as it continues to pursue its vision for artificial general intelligence that benefits “all of humanity.”\n\n“Our duties are to the mission, first and foremost, but the company — this amazing company that we’re in right now — was created to serve that mission,” Taylor said.",

Three authors are suing the GPU maker for copyright infringement.\n\nFirst reported by Reuters, authors Brian Keene, Abdi Nazemian, and Stewart O'Nan allege that one of Nvidia's large datasets used their books to train NeMo, the company's cloud-based toolkit for creating and customizing large language models (LLMs), without author consent. The lawsuit was filed late last week in the U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, with the plaintiffs seeking damages for the use of their novels.\n\nAlthough Nvidia is best known for its GeForce GTX and RTX line of desktop and laptop graphics cards, over the last several years, Nvidia has become a dominant force in artificial intelligence across both software and hardware markets. Nvidia's AI dominance helped the company reach a $2 trillion market cap late last month.\n\nNvidia did not immediately respond to IGN's request for comment.\n\nAI Training and Copyright Law\nWith the filing of this lawsuit, Nvidia joins a growing list of tech companies that are being sued over how it uses datasets to train its AI tech. Generative AI products like OpenAI's ChatGPT-3 or Google Bard require a substantial anount of data to train them, which has become a hot subject in copyright law as many, particularly creative professionals like artists and authors, take legal action for their work being used to train these technologies without their consent.\n\nOther AI-related copyrighted lawsuits include OpenAI, which is being sued by 18 authors, including Game of Thrones author George R R. Martin, for copyright infringement. Both Meta and Microsoft also face legal action in the same realm; the former used copyrighted books to train its LLMs, while Microsoft (and OpenAI) are being sued by The New York Times for alleged \"unauthorized use of published work\" to train its AI tech.\n\nWith many lawsuits filed within the last year, artificial intelligence may be a key component in changing United States copyright law. Tech companies argue that AI training is no different from how humans learn new things and that it is protected under \"fair use.\" In contrast, plaintiffs in these lawsuits argue that the lack of consent for using their work for AI training is a misuse of their work.",

The suit is similar to other lawsuits filed regarding AI copyright infringement.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for people in the U.S. whose copyrighted works helped train NeMo's large language models (LLMs) in the last three years. LLMs are used to power AI tools like NeMo, which Nvidia says is a fast and affordable way to adopt generative AI.\n\nAmong the works included in the lawsuit are Keene's 2008 novel \"Ghost Walk,\" Nazemian's 2019 novel \"Like a Love Story,\" and O'Nan's 2007 novella \"Last Night at the Lobster.\" \n\nThe suit claims the books were included in a data known as \"The Pile\" that contained a collection of books called \"Books3\" and Nvidia has admitted to training its NeMo Megatron AI models on The Pile and Books3. \n\nThe NeMo Megatron models were hosted on a website called Hugging Face that included a description of AI models' training dataset, which stated that the model was trained on The Pile. The Pile's Books3 dataset was listed on Hugging Face until October 2023, when the dataset was removed with a message that it \"is defunct and no longer accessible due to reported copyright infringement.\"\n\nNvidia declined to comment on the pending litigation.\n\nThe lawsuit drags Nvidia into a growing group of lawsuits against tech companies over the use of copyrighted content in training AI models, including several filed by writers as well as by the New York Times, which sued ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and Microsoft.\n\nNvidia's role as a leading chipmaker for in-demand AI chips has caused its stock to surge by nearly 600% since the end of 2022, giving the company a market value of nearly $2.2 trillion.",

            "text": "Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) traded lower early Monday morning following the company's worst one-day loss in ten months. Last Friday's drop represented a wipeout of $250 billion from the stock, spooking the broader market. A note from BTIG claims that consolidation in AI trade has been overdue.\n\nYahoo Finance Anchors Brad Smith and Seana Smith break down the latest developments for Nvidia and discuss the possibility of a stock split.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nSEANA SMITH: All right will to take a look at another Mag Seven name. And that is NVIDIA. Shares pulling back further in the pre-market. You can see it down just about 6/10 of a percent. It's been a wild couple of hours here. It had been trading higher this morning.\n\nNow, the chip maker saw its biggest one day loss in about 10 months on Friday. And that was enough to spook the broader market. We saw the pressure that then put on the S&P, and, obviously, the NASDAQ, as we closed out the trading week last week.\n\nAnd putting this in perspective, the drop that we saw on Friday at one point, when it had been off just about 6% in intraday trading, $250 billion have been wiped off the stock in just about three hours. So that really puts the drop in perspective here for investors.\n\nBTIG out with the note saying that the consolidation in the AI trade has been overdue for a while now. Friday's key reversal day could signal some more of that unwind that could be ahead.\n\nBRAD SMITH: Yeah. I just think back to some of our recent history in our conversation with Brian Belski, just a moment ago, talking about how he was looking at his own positioning within NVIDIA trading just a little bit here to start the year.\n\nAnd it's perhaps some of the behavior that's to be expected at this juncture. You've got NVIDIA sitting at all-time highs right now, essentially, over the past couple trading sessions. A little bit of profit taking so taking some chips off the table. Perhaps, some rotation into financials, into health care, some of the other hot sectors, like Brian was talking about, and some other strategists have put in front of us as well and made their cases for.\n\nBut now, it's a larger question of, does NVIDIA see an opportunity even for a stock split in the near future? What would that do for the retail investor out there? Does that make it more attractive than to pile more into the NVIDIA trade, even though we've seen this massive run up at this point? So making it more affordable on a share price perspective as an entry point. But still, I think, that is one area, where if it was to hit $1,000, where we might hear a little bit more talk about that potentially.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Yeah. We have certainly seen that talk really start to escalate here, at least, last week, just in terms of what that would do and the potential for that to actually happen.",
